```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)

dat <- penguins[penguins$species != "Chinstrap",]
dat <- dat[!is.na(dat$flipper_length_mm),]
```

The data we observe is flipper_length_mm. Seems like a well-separated Gaussian mixture. Group 1 is to the left and group 2 is to the right.

```{r}
hist(dat$flipper_length_mm)
```

Let $Z$ be a latent variable, if Z = 1, the penguin belongs to the group to the left and if Z = 2, the penguin belongs to the group to the right.

```{r}
# initialization
mu_a <- 185
sigma_a <- 10
p_a <- 0.5

mu_g <- 215
sigma_g <- 10
p_g <- 1-p_1
```

```{r}
prob_A_Z
```


Try implementing the EM algorithm for the penguin flipper length dataset (the relevant variable is flipper_length_mm). Use your final estimated probabilities to classify each penguin into either Adelie or Gentoo and estimate the means and standard deviations of species-specific normal distributions. Note that you actually have the true information available to you (donâ€™t use it for the EM algorithm, of course!). How accurate are your classifications? How close were your parameter estimates?
